    This thesis is the result of an effort to provide real-time machine
    recognition of hand-sent Morse code through the use of a minicomputer.
    While the capability to recognize hand-sent Morse code messages by
    machine has been demonstrated before on large scale special purpose
    computers, the main contribution of this study was to do it with a
    relatively inexpensive general purpose minicomputer.

    I wish to express my gratitude to my advisor, Lt. Col. Tom Purnhagen,
    for his assistance and guidance throughout the development of this study. I wish also to express my thanks to Captain JosÂ§eph Carl, of the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, for his appreciated support of this project as my laboratory sponsor, and to the Dayton Amateur Radio Association for their assistance in obtaining Morse code transmissions for use in this project. Special thanks are reserved for my wife and family for their sacrifices and patience while I spent my evenings conversing with the computer.
