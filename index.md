Abstract
---
The purpose of this investigation is to determine an optimum decision algorithm for use in machine recognition of hand-sent Morse code. An extensive analysis of hand-sent Morse code data is presented together with a discussion or the relative merits of several recognition algorithms. A recognition program is developed for use on the PDP-12 digital computer to test these algorithms. Test results are presented for a time duration averaging algorithm which achieves less than a one per cent recognition error rate for noise-free Morse code signals.
